Start
Step 1: Take user input of an integers list
Step 2: Initialize counter odd = 0, even = 0, index = 0
Step 3: Initialize length as length of the list
Step 4: If the number is divisible by 2 then add even by 1
Step 5: Else add odd by 1
Step 6: Increase the index by 1
Step 7: If the length is greater than index then goto step 4
Step 8: Print the total count of odd and even
