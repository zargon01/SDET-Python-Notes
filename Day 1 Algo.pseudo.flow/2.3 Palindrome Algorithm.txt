Start
Step 1: Take user input string.
Step 2: Initialize empty string reverse
Step 3: Initialize index as length of string -1
Step 4: Add char on index in reverse 
Step 5: Decrease index by 1
Step 6: If index is greater than 0 then goto step 4
Step 7: If string is equal to reverse then print string is a palindrome
Step 8: Else print string is not a palindrome
