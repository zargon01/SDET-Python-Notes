# Loops
Loops are used to **repeat a block of code multiple times**.

Python has **2 main types** of loops:

---

### 1. `for` Loop  
**Use when you know how many times to repeat** (Definite Iteration)

#### Syntax
```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code block
```

**Most Common: range()**

```python
# Print 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):        # start=1, end=5 (6 not included)
    print(i)
# Output: 1 2 3 4 5

# range(start, stop, step)
for i in range(0, 10, 2):    # even numbers
    print(i)
# Output: 0 2 4 6 8

for i in range(5):          # 0 to 4 (default start=0)
    print(i)

for i in range(10, 0, -1):  # countdown
    print(i)
# Output: 10 9 ... 1
```

**Loop through strings, lists, etc.**

```python
name = "Python"
for char in name:
    print(char)
# P y t h o n

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

### 2. `while` Loop
Use when you don’t know how many times to repeat (Repeats as long as condition is True)

#### Syntax
```python
while condition:
    # code block
    # Don't forget to update the condition!
```

**Example: Countdown**

```python
count = 5
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1      # VERY IMPORTANT!
print("Blast Off!")
```

**Example: Keep asking until correct**

```python
password = ""
while password != "secret123":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access Granted!")
```

**Warning:** If you forget to update the condition → Infinite Loop! (Use Ctrl+C to stop in terminal)

### Loop Control Statements (Jump Statements)

| Statement | Meaning                          | Example |
|-----------|---------------------------------|---------|
| `break`   | Exit the loop immediately       | Stop when found |
| `continue`| Skip the rest of current iteration | Skip current, go to next |
| `pass`    | Do nothing (placeholder)        | Used when syntax requires code |

**`break` Example**

```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
# Output: 1 2 3 4
```

**`continue` Example**

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue    # skip 3
    print(i)
# Output: 1 2 4 5
```

**`pass` Example**

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass    # I'll write code later
    print(i)
```

---

### `else` with Loops (Special Python Feature!)

`else` block runs only if loop completed normally (no break)

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished successfully!")

# But if break is used → else is skipped
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        print("Found!")
        break
else:
    print("Not found")   # This won't print
```

**Useful in searching:**

```python
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 7:
        print("7 found!")
        break
else:
    print("7 not found")
```

---

### Important: Python has NO do-while loop
In other languages:
```c
do {
    code
} while(condition);   // runs at least once
```

In Python → simulate with `while True` + `break`:

```python
while True:
    num = int(input("Enter positive number: "))
    if num > 0:
        break
    print("Negative! Try again.")
print("Thanks! You entered:", num)
```

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature       | for Loop                | while Loop               |
|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| When to use  | Known number of iterations | Unknown / condition-based |
| Syntax       | `for i in range(...):` | `while condition:`        |
| Risk of infinite loop | Rare                   | High (if condition not updated) |
| Best for     | Lists, range, strings  | User input, games, live conditions |
| Has else     | Yes                    | Yes                       |
