# Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are **decision-making** statements that allow your program to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions.

They help control the **flow of the program**.

---

### 1. `if` Statement
Executes a block only if the condition is **True**.

```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote!")
```

**Note:**
- Colon `:` is mandatory
- Indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab) defines the block
- If condition is False → block is skipped

---

### 2. `if-else` Statement
Provides an alternative block when the condition is False.

```python
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You cannot vote yet. Wait a few years!")
```

**Flow:**
- Condition True → run `if` block → skip `else`
- Condition False → skip `if` → run `else` block

---

### 3. `if-elif-else` Ladder
Checks multiple conditions one by one. Only the first True block runs.

```python
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A+")
elif marks >= 80:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 70:
    print("Grade: B")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F - Better luck next time!")
```

**Important:**
- `elif` means "else if"
- `else` is optional
- Only one block executes
- Execution stops after first True condition

---

### 4. Nested `if` Statements
`if` inside another `if` → used when we have multiple dependent conditions.

```python
age = 20
has_license = True
is_drunk = False

if age >= 18:
    print("Age is okay")
    
    if has_license:
        print("License verified")
        
        if not is_drunk:
            print("You can drive! Safe journey!")
        else:
            print("No driving! You're drunk.")
    else:
        print("License required!")
else:
    print("Too young to drive!")
```

**Real-life example – Login system:**

```python
username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if username == "admin":
    if password == "12345":
        print("Login Successful! Welcome")
    else:
        print("Wrong password!")
else:
    print("Unknown user!")
```

---

### Conditional Expression (Ternary Operator)
One-line `if-else` (also called inline if)

```python
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)  # Adult

# Same as:
if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else:
    status = "Minor"
```

**Useful for simple conditions:**

```python
print("Even" if num % 2 == 0 else "Odd")
```

## Summary Table

| Statement        | Checks Multiple? | Has Alternative? | Executes How Many Blocks? |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| `if`            | No                | No                | 0 or 1                     |
| `if-else`       | No                | Yes               | Exactly 1                  |
| `if-elif-else`  | Yes               | Optional          | At most 1                  |
| Nested `if`     | Yes (deep)        | Yes               | Multiple (depending)       |
